In the early September, my Surface Pro 4 has received the update 1607 for Win10. But as it failed to install the update at the first time, I have never receive it again.  

For the reason, I had tried all the methods online but nothing helpful.  

Even finally MircoSoft France gave me a new one to solve this issue, because they said there might be sth blocked with my hardware. I really found that sb like me have solved the same problem.  

So, I list some of these which may help you. If it do help you, please tell me :)

For me, I just guess there might be some part of reason with the Hyper-V or Virtual Box.
